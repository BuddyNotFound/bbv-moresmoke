**More Smoke** enhances your vehicle's drifting and starting/stopping effects by adding more smoke. You can toggle this feature on and off with a command. Customize the smoke's size and density, and choose whether the smoke comes from all wheels or just the rear ones.

```lua
Config.Settings = {
    SmokeSize = 0.3,
    SmokeDensity = 5,
    BackWheelsOnly = true,
    Command = "moresmoke"
}
```
